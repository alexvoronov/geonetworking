/**
 * Long Position Vector containing detailed station information.
 *
 * Usually used to describe sender position.
 *
 * Long Position Vector contains Geonetworking Address, Timestamp, Position, PAI, Speed and Heading.
 *
 * Timestamp.
 * time in milliseconds at which the latitude and longitude of the ITS-S were
 * acquired
 * by the GeoAdhoc router. The time is encoded as:
 * TST = TST(TAI) mod 2^32
 * where TST(TAI) is the number of elapsed TAI milliseconds since 2004-01-01
 * 00:00:00.000 UTC.
 * http://leapsecond.com/java/gpsclock.htm
 * TAI just adds 35 leap seconds to UTC.
 * 2^32 milliseconds is about 49 days.
 *
 * PAI.
 * Position accuracy indicator of the GeoAdhoc router reference position.
 * Set to 1 if the semiMajorConfidence of the PosConfidenceEllipse as specified
 * in ETSI TS 102 894-2 [i.7] is smaller than the GN protocol constant
 * itsGnPaiInterval / 2.
 * Set to 0 otherwise.
 *
 * Speed.
 * Later it has to be encoded as a 15 bit signed integer, where each unit is 0.01 m/s,
 * which gives maximum speed of (2^15 - 1) * 0.01 = 327.67 m/s = 1179.61 km/h.
 *
 * Heading.
 * Later it has to be encoded as an unsigned units of 0.1 degree from North.
